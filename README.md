# Assignment 2

**Middle Earth Battle Simulator 🏹🔥**

This code aims to simulate the outcomes of a hypothetical battle between the forces of Gondor and Saruman's dark army.

**Overview 📖**

In this simulation, we take into account the varying strengths of different military units, from infantry to mythical creatures like Nazguls. The strategy decided (whether to attack, defend, call for reinforcements, or flee) is based on the cumulative power of each side's forces.

**Units and Their Potencies 🛡️**

Gondor's Army:

Infantería (Infantry): Potencia 1
Caballería (Cavalry): Potencia 5
Catapultas (Catapults): Potencia 20

Saruman's Forces:

Orcos (Orcs): Potencia 1
Trolls: Potencia 10
Nazguls: Potencia 50
Code Features 🚀

Each army is represented as an object, with unit types as properties and their numbers as values.
The simulation determines the best course of action by comparing the cumulative strengths of both armies.
The code implements decision-making using both traditional if-else structures and a ternary operation for versatility.

**Testing the Simulation 🧪**

For testing purposes, the simulation uses the following data:

Gondor: 1000 infantry, 200 cavalry, 5 catapults
Saruman: 1500 orcs, 20 trolls, 5 nazguls

**Note 📌**

The terminology in the code is primarily in Spanish as this exercise was developed during a Spanish coding class.
